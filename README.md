# Approximating Low-Pass Filters with Neural Networks

## Project TODOs:

-[] Try Dropout1d instead of current Dropout2d
-[] Try Adam and SGD

## Run instructions


# Approach 1: Use create_50_models_and_train.sh
```sh
chmod +x create_50_models_and_train.sh
./create_50_models_and_train.sh
```

# Approach 2: Create Any Number of Models (Using a Range Spec) and Train
Before training, under the project directory, create e.g. 50 models

```sh
pwd # should print ../beam_nn
Example: python lib/create_hyperparam_search.py 50 hyperparam_ranges.json
```

This creates 50 models under the beam_nn/DNNs folder.

Then train these models by running lib/main.py:

```sh
python lib/main.py DNNs/
```

This should start the training process!


# CHANGES
1. (CUDA) Attempt to improve performance with `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True`
1. (CUDA) Attempt to improve performance by adding `pin_memory=True` to DataLoader
1. (CUDA) Attempt to improve performance by adding `async=True` in fit.py
